PROMPT:

I'd like to categorize the following text into tags such that I can later search for certain tags to find the text. Return the 5 most relevant tags in a JSON array, including any important product/framework names that are central to the content. Tags do not need to be a single word and should not include non-alphanumeric symbols. Tags should only be derived from the words/phrases directly present in the given text, without making any conceptual leaps or assumptions beyond that. Tags should be concise short phrases (max 2 or three words while preferring 1 word unless the meaning is lost) that accurately describe the key topics and concepts covered in the text, avoiding redundancy with other tags as well as marketing language or catchphrases. Explicitly only output the JSON array without any accompanying text,prose,analysis. Exclude proper nouns referring to specific applications or websites, unless they represent the core product/framework itself in which case ensure it is present once.
